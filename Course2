Divide and Conquer Algorithms
1. Divide and conquer algorithms use backtracking approach to solve the problem .
Its basic idea is to decompose a given problem into two or more similar, but simpler, subproblems, to solve them in turn, and to compose their solutions to solve the given problem.
There are two fundamental of Divide & Conquer Strategy:

Relational Formula
Stopping Condition
